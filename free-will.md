## Intro
- Thoughts & intentions emerge from background causes which we are unaware of
and have no conscious control over
- Conception of free will rests on 2 assumptions:
  - We could have behaved differently in the past
  - We are conscious of most of our thoughts and actions in the present
- Not even correspond to subjective fact about us: act of free will can't
be traced to a point of origin in our minds
- Related to:
  - Morality
  - Law
  - Politics
  - Religion
  - Relationship
  - Feeling of guilt
  - Personal accomplishment
  - -> Depend on viewing others as autonomous persons, capable of free choice
- No free will -> sinners & criminals = poorly calibrated clockwork
- -> No punishment, only rehabilitation & deterrence
- Deserve success?
- Why people are as they are? Why are we not like them?
When we trade place with them (atom for atom, same gene, same life experience,
same brain & body), we will become them, make the same decision
- Neuro disorder: only a special case of physical event giving rise
to thoughts & actions
