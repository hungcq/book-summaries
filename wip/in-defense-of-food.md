# Presentation & style
- Author's claims:
  - Use nutrition science findings mainly for explanation & understanding
- Clear arguments, backed by scientific/statistical evidences

# Terms
- Nutritionism: food & human bodies should only be understood and engaged with in terms of their nutritional & chemical constituents & requirements

# Arguments
## I - The age of nutritionism
### 1. From foods to nutrients
- History of the rise of nutritionism: how nutrients replaced food
- Why gov/scientific recommendations changed from food to nutrients:
  - Pressure from industries
  - Scientific reductionism bias
- -> New way of thinking about food & health

### 2. Nutritionism defined
- Basic assumptions of nutritionism:
  - Foods are the sum of their nutrient parts
  - -> Need scientists to explain & guide us
  - Goal of eating is to maintain & promote bodily health
  - -> Nutrients in food should be divided into healthy & unhealthy ones
- -> Not science but ideology
- Problems:
  - Promote food fads & phobias
  - Focus on measured nutrients, not qualitative differences among foods
  - -> No dif between foods & processed foods

### 3. Nutritionism comes to market
- Review of imitation law & how it got repealed

### 4. Food science's golden age
- The rise of processed food & food science
- Health claim: easy to acquire, no scientific basis
- Attitude toward whole food in the age of nutritionism:
  - Labeled good or bad depending on popular nutritional orthodoxy
  - No health claims -> subsided

### 5. The melting of the lipid hypothesis
- The lipid hypothesis:
  - Def: dietary fat is responsible for chronic disease
  - Conclusions of recent review: low-fat campaign has been based on little scientific evidence & caused unintended health consequences:
    - Dietary fat & cholesterol has weak/no association with coronary heart disease
    - Strong association between trans fats (encouraged by the campaign) & coronary heart disease
    - No convincing evidence supports that low-fat diet causes weight loss
  - -> No one publicly ack

### 6. Eat right, get fatter
- How the dietary advice was taken: eat more other things
- Parties benefiting from the dietary recommendation:
  - Food industries
  - Nutrition scientists
  - Journalists

### 7. Beyond the pleasure principle
- Psychological consequences of nutritionism:
  - Confusion & anxiety
  - Reduced pleasure in eating
  - Blame illness on life-style choices -> individuals are responsible
- Review of historical ideas that undervalue pleasure in eating
- -> Basis for nutritionism

### 8. The proof in the low-fat pudding
- Evidences against the low-fat campaign - consequences on public health:
  - Increased obesity & diabetes
  - No reduction in heart disease

### 9. Bad science
- Flaws & difficulties of nutrition science:
  - Problematic assumption: food = sum of nutrient parts
  - -> Flawed approach: study one nutrient at a time (basic tool of science: study one variable at a time):
    - Not suitable for human: genetic differences
    - Take nutrient out of context of food: complex interaction between various chemical components -> can't isolate one nutrient
    - Take food out of context of diet:
      - Foods are eaten in combination & order
      - -> Affect how they are metabolized
      - When people eat a lot of one type of food, they eat less of sth else:
      - -> Bad effects might not be the result of one food, but the lack of sth else
    - Take diet out of context of lifestyle: when studying dif population, effect might be result of lifestyle, not diet
      (eg People taking supplements are more health-conscious. Supplements usually have no effect.)
  - Scientific tools too simple to understand complex systems as food & diet:
    - In experiments: when reduce sth, sth else is eaten instead
    - -> Always a second variable
    - Can't correct for placebo effect: no fake foods that taste like real foods
    - Focus on known nutrients -> subjected to continuous changes
    - Consult food nutrient value based on a standard table
    - -> Not account for qualitative differences
    - Flaws of 3 main methods of studying impact of diet:
      - Case-control study:
        - Method: ask how sick people eat -> determine causes in the diet
        - Problems:
          - Sick people might change the way they eat
          - Cause-seeking: people tend to report the current evil nutrient
      - Cohort study:
        - Method: collect data on eating habits & health outcomes of dif cohort groups over the long term
        - Problems:
          - Sample groups are quite uniform: all eat the same Western diet
          - -> Differences is not significant
          - -> Effect might not be detectable
          - Problems of food-frequency questionnaires:
            - People lie about their diet
            - Difficult questions & unreliable human memory -> can't recall
          - -> Unreliable data, easy to misinterprete/overinterprete
          - -> Can only be used to rank people on consumption of dif types of food
      - Intervention study:
        - Method:
          - Use a control group & a group that changes its diet following a prescription
          - Track both groups over the long run
          - -> Whether the intervention affects rates of chronic disease
        - Problems:
          - Same as cohort study
          - Changes in diet of control group (following recommendation) & other group (failed to follow prescription)
