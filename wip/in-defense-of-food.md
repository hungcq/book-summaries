# Arguments
## I - The age of nutritionism
### 1. From foods to nutrients
- History of the rise of nutritionism: how nutrients replaced food
- Why gov/scientific recommendations changed from food to nutrients:
  - Pressure from industries
  - Scientific reductionism bias
- -> New way of thinking about food & health

### 2. Nutritionism defined
- Basic assumptions of nutritionism:
  - Foods are the sum of their nutrient parts
  - -> Need scientists to explain & guide us
  - Goal of eating is to maintain & promote bodily health
  - -> Nutrients in food should be divided into healthy & unhealthy ones
- Problems:
  - Promote food fads & phobias
  - Focus on measured nutrients, not qualitative differences among foods
  - -> No dif between foods & processed foods

### 3. Nutritionism comes to market
- Review of imitation law & how it got repealed

### 4. Food science's golden age
- The rise of processed food & food science
- Attitude toward whole food in the age of nutritionism:
  - Labeled good or bad depending on popular nutritional orthodoxy
  - No health claims -> subsided

### 5. The melting of the lipid hypothesis
- The lipid hypothesis:
  - Def: dietary fat is responsible for chronic disease
  - Conclusions of recent review: low-fat campaign has been based on little scientific evidence & caused unintended health consequences:
    - Dietary fat & cholesterol has weak/no association with coronary heart disease
    - Strong association between trans fats (encouraged by the campaign) & coronary heart disease
