# Category
Behavioral economics, economics. Contains bio, stories & history of behavioral economics.

# Summary
The author tells the history of behavioral economics through his perspective.
Important findings and experiments in the field are described, the difference with formal economic theory are highlighted.
The author also presents its influence on public policy and prediction of future focus in the last part of the book.

# Structure
- Narrative style: ideas come out at dif time/speed
- Structure: both chronological & topical:
  - Part 1 (I): early years & early findings conflicting with formal models
  - Part 2 (II - VI): some topics of behavioral economics:
      - Mental accounting
      - Self-control
      - Fairness
      - Finance
  - Part 3 (VII): recent research endeavors
  - Part 4 (VIII): new challenges & opportunities

# Author problems & solution
- Tell the story about the development of behavioral economics

  - Improve understanding about human behaviors
  - Provide lessons about how to change the way people think about things, especially when they try to maintain the status quo

# Terms
- Misbehave
- Constraint optimization
- Rational choice theory
- Rational expectation
- Formal vs behavioral economics
- Opportunity cost
- Endowment effect
- Bounded rationality
- Normative vs descriptive (positive) theory
- Weber-Fechner Law

# Arguments

## I - Beginning

### 1. Supposedly irrelevant factors (SIF)
- People misbehaving: their behaviors were inconsistent with the idealized model of economic theory
- Problem: the model replace human with Econ
- -> Humans misbehave
- -> Economic models make bad predictions about human behaviors
- -> Can lead to serious consequences
- Core premises of economic theory: optimization & equilibrium:
  - Optimization (rational choice theory):
    - Constraint optimization: people, with limited budget, always pick the best option available
    - Rational expectation: their choices are unbiased (correctly assessing probability)
  - Equilibrium: supply = demand in competitive market
- Flaws of optimization premise:
  - Optimization problems are often too hard for ordinary people to solve: too many options
  - Their choices are biased, overconfident
  - Many factors being left out by the model (eg irrational, psychological)
- -> Need an enriched approach to doing economic research, acknowledging the existence & relevance of humans
- Don't need to throw away everything previously built in economics:
  - Theories based on the assumption that everyone is an Econ:
    - Can be starting points for more realistic models
    - Can be good approximation in special circumstances:
      - Optimization problems to solve are easy
      - Actors in the economy have relevant, highly specialized skills
  - Most market research & analysis:
    - Are done with great care & statistical expertise
    - Doesn't depend on the optimization premise
  - 2 useful research tools:
    - Randomized control trial experiments: what happens when some people receive some "treatment" of interest
    - Naturally occurring experiments/clever economic techniques: detect impact of treatments without conducting designed experiments
  - -> Can learn a lot about the world without imposing optimizing models
  - -> Can provide credible evidence to test optimizing models
- Predictions of economic theory:
  - Safe when it is imprecise: only predict the general direction of the effect
  - Problematic when it is highly specific: depend explicitly on everyone optimizes (being economically sophisticated)
- What to do:
  - Stop assuming abstract models are accurate descriptions of behavior
  - -> Stop basing policy decisions on those flawed analyses
  - Start paying attention to SIF
- Behavioral economics: economics done with strong injections of psychology & other social sciences
- -> More accurate predictions, more fun to learn (lol)
#### Additional info
- The formal models give economics the reputation as the most powerful of the social sciences:
  - Influencing public policy
  - Intellectually: have unified core theory, everything else follows, like physical science
- Recently, behavioral economics & science are being integrated into:
  - Policy-making establishment
  - Businesses

### 2. The endowment effect
- Opportunity cost: what you give up by doing some activity:
  - Formal prediction: people should treat opportunity cost equal to out-of-pocket cost
  - -> Logical thing to do
  - Reality: it hurts more to pay out-of-pocket cost
- -> Endowment effect: people value: things already owned > things available but not yet owned

### 3. The list
- Bounded rationality: lack the cognitive ability to solve complex problems
- -> Formal eco handle it by adding error term to the equation
- -> Believe that as long as the errors are random, its opposing effects will cancel each other out
- The errors not random but systematic bias

### 4. Value theory
- Normative vs descriptive theory:
  - Normative: tell the logically consistent way to think about some problem (eg rational choice theory)
  - Descriptive (positive) theory: describe how people actually solve the problem in the real world
- Formal eco use one theory for both normative & descriptive purposes
- Prospect theory (called Value theory in early version):
  - Loss aversion
  - -> Endowment effect
  - Diminishing sensitivity
  - -> Reflect basic human trait: Weber-Fechner Law:
  the just-noticeable difference in any variable is proportional to the magnitude of that variable
  - -> Risk-averse for gains, risk-seeking for losses
  - Focus on changes in wealth instead of levels of wealth
- -> Offer a good prediction of actual choices, not a guide to rational choice
- -> Break away from one-theory approach
