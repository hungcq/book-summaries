# Misbehaving

## Category
Behavioral economics, economics. Contains bio, stories & history of behavioral economics.

## Summary

## Structure
- Narrative style: ideas come out at dif time/speed
- Structure: both chronological & topical:
  - Part 1 (I): early years & early findings conflicting with formal models
  - Part 2 (II - VI): some topics of behavioral economics:
      - Mental accounting
      - Self-control
      - Fairness
      - Finance
  - Part 3 (VII): recent research endeavors
  - Part 4 (VIII): new challenges & opportunities (influencing public policy?)

## Author problems & solution
- Tell the story about the development of behavioral economics
- Explain some discoveries of the field (in Part 2). Aim:
  - Improve understanding about human behaviors
  - Provide lessons about how to change the way people think about things, especially when they try to maintain the status quo

## Terms
- Misbehave (see [Chap 1](#1-supposedly-irrelevant-factors-sif))
- Constraint optimization (see [Chap 1](#1-supposedly-irrelevant-factors-sif))
- Rational expectation (see [Chap 1](#1-supposedly-irrelevant-factors-sif))
- Behavioral economics (see [Chap 1](#1-supposedly-irrelevant-factors-sif))

## Arguments

### I - Beginning

#### 1. Supposedly irrelevant factors (SIF)
- People misbehaving: their behaviors were inconsistent with the idealized model of economic theory
- Problem: the model replace human with Econ
- -> Humans misbehave
- -> Economic models make bad predictions about human behaviors
- -> Can lead to serious consequences
- The formal models give economics the reputation as the most powerful of the social sciences:
  - Influencing public policy
  - Intellectually: have unified core theory, everything else follows, like physical science
- Core premises of economic theory: optimization & equilibrium:
  - Optimization:
    - Constraint optimization: people, with limited budget, always pick the best option available
    - Rational expectation: their choices are unbiased (correctly assessing probability)
  - Equilibrium: supply = demand in competitive market
- Flaws of optimization premise:
  - Optimization problems are often too hard for ordinary people to solve: too many options
  - Their choices are biased, overconfident
  - Many factors being left out by the model (eg irrational, psychological)
- -> Need an enriched approach to doing economic research, acknowledging the existence & relevance of humans
- Don't need to throw away everything previously built in economics:
  - Theories based on the assumption that everyone is an Econ:
    - Can be starting points for more realistic models
    - Can be good approximation in special circumstances:
      - Optimization problems to solve are easy
      - Actors in the economy have relevant, highly specialized skills
  - Most market research & analysis:
    - Are done with great care & statistical expertise
    - Doesn't depend on the optimization premise
  - 2 useful research tools:
    - Randomized control trial experiments: what happens when some people receive some "treatment" of interest
    - Naturally occurring experiments/clever economic techniques: detect impact of treatments without conducting designed experiments
  - -> Can learn a lot about the world without imposing optimizing models
  - -> Can provide credible evidence to test optimizing models
- Predictions of economic theory:
  - Safe when it is imprecise: only predict the general direction of the effect
  - Problematic when it is highly specific: depend explicitly on everyone optimizes (being economically sophisticated)
- What to do:
  - Stop assuming abstract models are accurate descriptions of behavior
  - -> Stop basing policy decisions on those flawed analyses
  - Start paying attention to SIF
- Behavioral economics: economics done with strong injections of psychology & other social sciences
- -> More accurate predictions, more fun to learn (lol)
- Recently, behavioral economics & science are being integrated into:
  - Policy-making establishment
  - Businesses
