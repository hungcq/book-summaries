## Terms
- Ineptitude

## Arguments
### Introduction
- 3 causes of human failure:
  - Necessary fallibility: the task is beyond human capacity
  - When the task is within human capacity:
    - Ignorance: science has given us only a partial understanding of the world
    - Ineptitude: the knowledge exists, but we fail to apply it correctly
    - -> Make people emotional, angry
    - -> But usually happens despite great effort, not lack of it
- Over the last decades, due to development in science, knowledge & sophistication has increased dramatically
- -> The balance has shifted toward ineptitude
- Traditional solution to ineptitude problem: accumulate more exp by training & practice
- -> The problem still persist despite increased, intense training
- -> Reason: volume & complexity of knowledge has exceeded individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely & reliably
- Checklist as a new solution:
  - Build on exp & take adv of existing knowledge
  - Make up for inevitable human inadequacies

### 1. The problem of extreme complexity
- Modern medicine has shifted from one-pill-cures-all-illnesses model to an art of managing extreme complexity
- Complexity arise from:
  - Breath quantity of knowledge -> difficulty of choosing the right solution
  - Difficulty of execution
- Current solution of medicine to handle complexity: super-specialization: split the tasks among various specialties. Advs:
  - Specialized knowledge
  - Experience with the particular task
- -> Steps are still missed, mistakes are still made
