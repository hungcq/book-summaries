## Summary
Explaining different aspect of human behaviors, especially those driven by dopamine.
Arguments are supported by data, experiment results, evolutionary history and biological mechanisms.

## Structure

  - Distinguish between 2 dif types of things: within reach & out of reach
  - 2 corresponding modes of thinking: H&N chemicals & dopamine
  - Introduce problems in some chapters
  - Some notes about presentations & styles

## Author problems & solutions
- Explain the biological mechanism of dopamine: OK at a surface level
- Explain how it is related to different behaviors: OK in early chapters, not complete in chap 5, 6
- Offer ways to achieve balance & happiness: OK

## Presentation & styles
- No outline
- Some parts are speculative, esp later chapter
- There are simplification to make things easier to grasp
- Select studies:
  - Reflecting general consensus, not all contradicting studies
  - Highlight anomaly, sensitive behaviors
- Use lots of individual examples & stories

## Arguments

## Criticism
- Focus on biological factors. A complete analysis of behaviors would need to take into accounts the nurture factors. Some warrants on p.153-154.
- Some examples & stories are irrelevant
- Chap 5 - Politics might go too far: studies are mainly about correlation between political view and behaviors, not inner mechanism (dopaminergic or not)
- Chap 6: predictions are too pessimistic, uncritical, far-fetched, shallow & technologist
