## Author problems & solutions
- Explain the biological mechanism of dopamine: OK at a surface level
- Explain how it is related to different behaviors: OK in early chapters, not complete in chap 5, 6
- Offer ways to achieve balance & happiness: OK

## Presentation & styles
- Author notes:
  - Some parts are speculative, esp later chapter
  - There are simplification to make things easier to grasp
  - Select studies:
    - Reflecting general consensus, not all contradicting studies
    - Highlight anomaly, sensitive behaviors
- No outline
- Use lots of individual examples & stories
- There are some things in common between parts in each chapter, but the connections are not strong enough
- There are digressions but usually interesting enough

## Terms
- Reward prediction error
- Peripersonal vs extrapersonal
- Romance: dopamine thrill at the start of relationship
- H&N (here and now) chemicals: serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins, endocannabinoids chemicals
- Passionate (usually 12-18 months) vs companionate love (after)
- Impulsiveness
- Self-efficacy
- Agentic vs affiliative relationship
- Submissive vs dominant behavior/posture
- Planned vs spontaneous violence
- Dopaminergic personality

## Arguments
### 1. Love
- Dopamine is not a marker of pleasure. It is a reaction to the unexpected - possibility and anticipation
- Dopamine rushes come from promising surprises (eg new, unexpected messages (content not revealed), new people...)
- -> Stop when things become regular events
- Reward prediction error:
  - We constantly make predictions about what is coming next
  - Dopamine rush comes:
    - When what happens is better than expected
    - There is a possibility of it
- Peripersonal vs extrapersonal things:
  - Peripersonal: up close, in direct contact, focused on the present moment
  - Extrapersonal: at a distance, thinking abstractly, focused on the future
- Brain deals with peripersonal &extrapersonal in dif ways
- H&N chemicals give pleasure from sensation & emotion from peripersonal space
- Getting things in extrapersonal space requires effort, time & planning
- -> Dopamine exercise control when brain is engaged with extrapersonal space: to maximize resources in the future, to pursuit better things
- Dopamine doesn't react to having things, only to getting new things
- -> Need to transition to H&N chemicals to enjoy things we have
- Same with acquiring (extrapersonal) & maintaining love (peripersonal)
- -> Need to transition to experience the H&N (satisfaction) after early romance/passionate love (pursuit)
- Long term rela chemicals: oxytocin (more in female) & vasopressin (male)
- Glamour: when we see things that stimulate our dopaminergic imagination, drowning out our ability to accurately perceive H&N reality
- -> Create desires that cannot be fulfilled because they are only in our imagination
- Unpredictable/random reward -> more dopamine -> more attempts
- -> Gambling behaviors
- Testosterone:
  - Related to muscular features: facial hair, increased muscle mass, low-pitched voice
  - Vary mostly between individuals
  - H&N chemical, create sexual desire (any partner can satisfy) in both male & female
  - Not suppressed but work together with dopamine
  - Suppressed by long term rela chemicals (oxytocin & vasopressin)
- -> Related to marry behavior: naturally high = less likely to marry. Marry = reduced testosterone level
- Sex:
  - First stage: desire & arousal: dopaminergic, future-looking
  - Physical contact & orgasm: H&N experience (endorphins), dopamine region (prefrontal cortex) shut down
  - -> Need to focus on present to enjoy sex
- Suppressing sexual behavior can prolong passionate love
- High level of dopamine naturally:
  - High number of sexual partners
  - Low age of first sexual intercourse

### 2. Drugs
- Aristotle's idea: ultimate purpose of all actions: happiness
- -> Issue: usually lack of consideration for purpose: just do what we want at that moment
- Desire dopamine mechanism:
  - Circuit: mesolimbic pathway (dopamine desire circuit):
    - <img src="../resources/the-molecule-of-more/1.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
    - Cells wind through ventral tegmental area (old part of brain) to nucleus accumbens
    - These cells activated -> release dopamine to nucleus accumbens -> motivation feeling
  - -> Evolved to promote survival & reproduction
  - Dopamine desire system constantly scans the env for evolutionarily attractive resources & opportunities
  - Desire circuit are activated when those things appear, whether or not these things are actually needed
  - -> Send signal to pay attention by feeling of desire & usually excitement
  - -> Sensation of wanting is not a choice to make but a reaction to things encountered
  - Also contribute to the formation of memories related to those things
  - -> Shaping brain to make surprising events predictable to maximize resources
  - -> Important to neuroplasticity
  - -> No more surprise & reward prediction error
  - Might be opposed by dopamine control circuit
  - -> Evolutionary explanation: systems containing opposing forces are easier to control
- Effect on behavior: dopamine activation in desire circuit triggers energy, enthusiasm & hope -> feel good
- -> People pursuit this feeling of anticipation, of life is about to get better
- Imagination of future possibilities tend to be idealized
- Liking circuit (H&N): tiny, fragile & harder to trigger, compare to dopamine desire system
- Buyer's remorse:
  - Cause: failure of the H&N experience (enjoyment) to compensate for the loss of dopa arousal (excitement)
  - Solutions:
    - Make a wise purchase
    - Purchase sth that triggers more dopa expectation after the purchase
    - Purchase less
- Drug abuse:
  - Cause: addictive drugs hit the desire circuit with intense chemical blast, > all natural behaviors
  - Mechanism:
    - Dif vs natural behavior: bypass circuitry of surprise & prediction -> desire circuit doesn't shut down after performing the behavior
    - -> Always want more
    - Stimulate dopamine release no matter the current situation
    - -> Connect drug use to everything -> drug becomes answer to all aspect of life
    - Level of addiction: depend on
      - Level of dopa stimulation. More dopa = more addictive.
      - On set time: faster = more addictive. Fastest: smoking, intravenous injection.
    - Diminishing stimulation: only craving is intense, high is less
    - Usually also boost impulsiveness (see impulsive behavior below)
    - Drug that trigger both desire & liking circuit: heroin, OxyContin, marijuana
    - Marijuana effect:
      - Dopa boosting:
        - Engage with things that are usually perceived as unimportant
        - Lost in thoughts, float in imaginary world
      - Other situation: suppress dopamine, mimicking H&N
      - -> Activities associated with wanting and motivation seem less important
    - Nicotine effect: main effect: triggering compulsive use. Little stimulation.
  - Addiction also depends on easy access: easier = more common
  - -> Porn addiction (has sth in common with drug addiction) becomes more common after the internet
- When expected reward fails to materialize, dopamine firing rate drops to zero (compare to normal of 5 times/s)
- -> Dopamine shutdown creates feeling of resentful & deprived
- -> Drug abuser will continue to use to get a relief from the low when diminishing stimulation set in
- Drunk vs high:
  - High: depend on how fast alcohol gets into the brain
  - -> Drink drinks that are more concentrated & easier to drink (eg mixed drink > beer)
  - Drunk: depend on total amount of alcohol consumed
- Impulsive behavior: occur when too much value is placed on immediate pleasure, not on long term consequences
- -> Desire dopa overpowers rational parts of the brain
- Parkinson's disease: dopamine deficiency in pathway that's responsible for controlling muscle movement
- -> Treatment: dopamine boosting drug
- Side effect of dopa boosting drug (effect possibly depends on genetic vulnerability):
  - Boost impulsive behavior (eg risk taking)
  - Expect to win bigger
  - Hypersexuality (high sexual urges)
- Adolescent brains: not fully developed, esp the frontal lobes (only after early 20s)
- -> More impulsiveness & bad decisions
- -> More negative consequences from video games
- Addictive factors of video games:
  - Surprising factors from unpredictable rewards
  - -> Reward prediction errors (eg opening chests)
  - Endless possibilities of open environments to explore
  - Display of progress to trigger pursuit of more
  - Social pleasure:
    - H&N: company of others
    - Dopaminergic: work together towards a shared goal (better future)
  - H&N: beautiful scenery

### 3. Domination
- Dopamine control circuit (meso-cortical circuit):
  - <img src="../resources/the-molecule-of-more/2.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
  - Start from ventral tegmental area, end in frontal lobes (specialized in logical thinking)
  - Manage uncontrolled urges of desire dopamine. Decide what sort of "more" is worth having.
  - Take the energy of desire and guide it toward profitable ends
  - Give us the ability to use abstract concepts, construct plans, strategize
  - -> Gain control, dominate the world to get the things we want
  - Source of imagination: imagine consequences of decisions -> help make decision
  - -> Also work in the unreal world of the possible
  - Give us ability to consider: ideas, plans theories, abstract concepts, worlds yet to be
  - Evolutionary aim: secure as many resources as possible
  - -> Reward: feeling good
  - Behavior towards others: can be aggressive or submissive, depends on the context
  - Source of persistence & effort: willingness to do more work to get better things
  - Source of ability to suppress emotions
  - -> Stay calm in complex situations, develop plan to secure more resources
- Early success can positively influence persistence: having a confident expectation of success (self-efficacy)
- Dominant vs submissive posture:
  - Dominant posture: expand body, take large amount of space
  - Submissive posture: constrict body
  - People are more likely to unconsciously adopt complementary posture rather than mirror the same dominant/submissive posture (unlike other actions during a talk)
  - -> Like & feel more comfortable compared to mirroring posture
- -> Submission to self-efficacy
- Some goals require working with other people
- Agentic vs affiliative relationship:
  - Agentic rela:
    - Formed for the purpose of accomplish a goal
    - Orchestrated by dopamine
    - The other person acts as an agent assisting you in achieving your goal
    - Can be passive, as long as can achieve the goal
  - Affiliative rela:
    - Purpose: enjoy social interactions
    - Pleasure: being with another person (H&N)
  - Most relationships have both affiliative & agentic elements
  - Preference depends on individuals:
    - Agentic people (prefer agentic rela): cool & distant
    - Affiliative people: affectionate & warm, social, turn for others for support. Likely to be friendly, accessible followers.
    - Good at both: friendly, accessible leaders
    - Bad at both: distant & isolated
- Submissive behavior can be a sign of elevated social status (courtesy)
- Dominant behavior may stem from personal insecurity or imperfect education
- Effect of high level of control dopamine, imbalance between dopamine & H&N neurotransmitters:
  - Work relentlessly toward goals but never stop to enjoy the fruits of achievement, don't even brag about those achievements
  - -> Achieve sth, move on to the next
  - Usually unhappy
- Effect of low level of control dopamine:
  - Struggle with internal control: impulsive, facing difficulty when trying to focus on complex tasks
  - Can result in ADHD
- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD):
  - Symptoms: poor focus & concentration, poor impulse control
  - Seen most often in children: not fully developed frontal lobes
  - Consequences:
    - High-risk, pleasure-seeking behavior: drug addiction, early sexual activity, obesity
    - Unable to focus -> can't extract resources from the env
    - Difficulty making friends
    - Overreaction
  - Treatment: medication to increase dopamine level
- Dopamine can suppress feelings of guilt (H&N emotion) -> can lead to deceit/violence
- Cheating to win: dopamine surge from winning (evolutionary cause) make us want to win more
- Spontaneous vs planned violence:
  - Spontaneous violence: set off by passion (H&N), dopamine is suppress
  - -> Degrade the inflicter's future well-being
  - Planned violence:
    - Effective strategy, planned in advance, sometimes in detail
    - Aim at gaining resources or control
    - Low emotional content (cold violence) -> advantage in the midst of conflict
- Dopaminergic personality: focus on making the future more rewarding at the expense of being able to experience joys of the present
  - Active desire circuit naturally: impulsive, difficult to satisfy, constantly seeking more
  - Active control circuit naturally:
    - Cold & calculating
    - Ruthless & devoid of emotion, better ability to suppress emotion
    - Interested more in winning competitions
- Norepinephrine (adrenaline in the brain): H&N chemical of fight or flight (panic)
- Out of willpower: give up easily when frustrated
- Psychotherapy to treat addiction:
  - Goal: pit one part of the brain against another:
  - Popular types:
    - Motivational enhancement therapy: encourage patients to talk about healthy desires
    - -> Use as source of endurance when dopamine circuit shuts down without drug
    - Cognitive behavioral therapy: plan to handle cues of desire
    - 12-step facilitation therapy (Alcoholic Anonymous):
      - Form relationship with other members of group
      - Use H&N experience of guilt (letting others down)

## Criticism
- Focus on biological factors. A complete analysis of behaviors would need to take into accounts the nurture factors. Some warrants on p.153-154.
- Some examples & stories are irrelevant
- Chap 2 use an actual example (Buzz Aldrin) but there is no data supporting the claim that he has high level of control dopamine
- Chap 5 - Politics might go too far: studies are mainly about correlation between political view and behaviors, not inner mechanism (dopaminergic or not)
- Chap 6: predictions are too pessimistic, uncritical, far-fetched, shallow & technologist
