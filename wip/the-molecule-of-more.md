## Summary
Explaining different aspect of human behaviors, especially those driven by dopamine.
Arguments are supported by data, experiment results, evolutionary history and biological mechanisms.

## Structure
- Introduction:
  - Distinguish between 2 dif types of things: within reach (peripersonal) & out of reach (extrapersonal)
  - 2 corresponding modes of thinking: H&N chemicals & dopamine
  - Introduce problems in some chapters
  - Some notes about presentations & styles
- Chap 1:
  - Set the problem: what is the function of dopamine if not pleasure?
  - Dopamine & H&N terms & mechanisms
  - Anticipation of new possibilities
  - Evolutionary explanation
  - Glamour: definition & issue
  - Gambling behavior
  - H&N molecules, love & sex implication
  - Effect of testosterone
  - How dopa drive sexual behavior & prevent enjoyment of sexual experience
  - Effect of suppressing sexual behavior
  - Chapter summary
- Chap 2:
- Chap 3:
- Chap 4:
- Chap 5:
- Chap 6:
- Chap 7:

## Author problems & solutions
- Explain the biological mechanism of dopamine: OK at a surface level
- Explain how it is related to different behaviors: OK in early chapters, not complete in chap 5, 6
- Offer ways to achieve balance & happiness: OK

## Presentation & styles
- No outline
- Some parts are speculative, esp later chapter
- There are simplification to make things easier to grasp
- Select studies:
  - Reflecting general consensus, not all contradicting studies
  - Highlight anomaly, sensitive behaviors
- Use lots of individual examples & stories

## Terms
- Reward prediction error
- Peripersonal vs extrapersonal
- Romance: dopamine thrill at the start of relationship
- H&N (here and now) chemicals: serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins, endocannabinoids chemicals
- Passionate (usually 12-18 months) vs companionate love (after)
- Dopaminergic personality (brain naturally produce more dopamine):
  - High number of sexual partners
  - Low age of first sexual intercourse

## Arguments
### 1. Love
- Dopamine is not a marker of pleasure. It is a reaction to the unexpected - possibility and anticipation
- Dopamine rushes come from promising surprises (eg new, unexpected messages (content not revealed), new people...)
- -> Stop when things become regular events
- Reward prediction error:
  - We constantly make predictions about what is coming next
  - Dopamine rush comes:
    - When what happens is better than expected
    - There is a possibility of it
- Brain deals with within reach things (peripersonal) & out of reach things (extrapersonal) in dif ways
- H&N chemicals give pleasure from sensation & emotion from peripersonal space
- Getting things in extrapersonal space requires effort, time & planning
- -> Dopamine exercise control when brain is engaged with extrapersonal space: to maximize resources in the future, to pursuit better things
- Dopamine doesn't react to having things, only to getting new things
- -> Need to transition to H&N chemicals to enjoy things we have
- Same with acquiring (extrapersonal) & maintaining love (peripersonal)
- -> Need to transition to experience the H&N (satisfaction) after early romance/passionate love (pursuit)
- Long term rela chemicals: oxytocin (more in female) & vasopressin (male)
- Glamour: when we see things that stimulate our dopaminergic imagination, drowning out our ability to accurately perceive H&N reality
- -> Create desires that cannot be fulfilled because they are only in our imagination
- Unpredictable/random reward -> more dopamine -> more attempts
- -> Gambling behaviors
- Testosterone:
  - Related to muscular features: facial hair, increased muscle mass, low-pitched voice
  - Vary mostly between individuals
  - H&N chemical, create sexual desire (any partner can satisfy) in both male & female
  - Not suppressed but work together with dopamine
  - Suppressed by long term rela chemicals (oxytocin & vasopressin)
- -> Related to marry behavior: naturally high = less likely to marry. Marry = reduced testosterone level
- Sex:
  - First stage: desire & arousal: dopaminergic, future-looking
  - Physical contact & orgasm: H&N experience (endorphins), dopamine region (prefrontal cortex) shut down
  - -> Need to focus on present to enjoy sex
- Suppressing sexual behavior can prolong passionate love

### 2. Drugs


## Criticism
- Focus on biological factors. A complete analysis of behaviors would need to take into accounts the nurture factors. Some warrants on p.153-154.
- Some examples & stories are irrelevant
- Chap 5 - Politics might go too far: studies are mainly about correlation between political view and behaviors, not inner mechanism (dopaminergic or not)
- Chap 6: predictions are too pessimistic, uncritical, far-fetched, shallow & technologist
