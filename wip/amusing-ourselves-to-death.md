# Arguments
## Foreword
- Brave new world's warning is more relevant than 1984:
people will love technologies that provide distraction, deprive them capacity to think
- -> Risk of becoming a trivial culture

## 1. The medium is the metaphor


# Criticism
- Examples & events in chap 3 seems like cherry-picked
- Arguments in chap 3, 4 are mostly historical & based on observation. Psychological/neurological causes are not provided.
- -> Author did claim at the beginning
- Discussion of TV news only focus on entertainment, not the emotional aspect (eg attraction of negative news)
