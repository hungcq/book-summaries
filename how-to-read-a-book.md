# How to read a book

## I - The dimensions of reading

### 1. The activity and art of reading
- Active reading:
  - Must actively receive (catch) the sent info/message  
  -> Need skills to receive well dif kinds of communication
  - To read better:
    - More active
    - Perform the acts involved more skillfully
- Goals of reading:
  - Read for entertainment: least demanding, no rules
  - Read for information: understand what the author comm.
  Both reader & author has common understanding.
  - Read for understanding (this book's focus): when don't understand fully what 
  the author comm  
  -> Can increase understanding (bigger picture, connections)  
  -> Art of reading: understand more without external help
- Conditions for reading for understanding:
  - Initial inequality in understanding
  - Reader's ability to overcome this inequality in some degree
- Reading as learning:
  - Learn by instruction: still active - aided discovery
  - vs Learn by discovery (unaided discovery)
- Present teachers (attending lecture, listening) vs absent teachers (reading)

### 2. The levels of reading: 4 levels
- Elementary: understand what the words in the sentence mean
- Inspectional (skimming systematically):
  - Understand what the book is about, what is its structure
  - Aim: get the most out of a book within given time
- Analytical reading:
  - Thorough, complete reading, for the sake of understanding
  - Aim: get the most out of a book given unlimited time
- Syntopical reading:
  - Read many books revolved around one subject
  - Aim:
    - Place the books in relation to one another
    - Construct an analysis of the subject which may not in any books

### 3. Elementary reading

### 4. Inspectional reading
- 2 steps:
  - Skimming
  - Superficial reading
- Skimming: at most 1 hour:
  - Aim: decide whether the book is worth an analytical reading
  - Where to look at:
    - Page title, subtitle & preface -> scope, aim & category of the book
    - Table of contents: structure
    - Index: range of topics covered, authors & books referred
    - Check some passages of crucial terms
    - Blurb: may contain main point, may be just a puff -> the book has nothing to say
    - The chapters that seem pivotal to its argument: summary statements
    in opening/closing pages
    - Read randomly 1-2 paragraphs/pages
    - Last few pages (not epilogue): authors may sum up what they think is new/imp
- Superficial reading:
  - Avoid expecting too much the first read through of a difficult book
  - Rule: for the first read through:
    - Don't stop to look up/ponder things you don't
    understand right away
    - Concentrate on what can be understood
  - -> Avoid getting lost & help the second reading
- Reading speed:
  - Should vary with nature & complexity of the material
  - Avoid fixations & regressions: use finger as pointers, move it faster than
  what your eyes are comfortable  
  -> Can improve concentration but not much comprehension

### 5. How to be a demanding reader: Ask & answer questions while reading
- 4 questions an active reader asks:
  - What is the book about as a whole  
  -> Leading theme, how the theme is ordered/divided
  - What is being said in details, and how  
  -> Main ideas, assertions & arguments of a particular message
  - Is the book true, in whole or part?
  - What of it?
    - Info: why does the author think it is imp to know these things? Is it imp
    to you to know them?
    - Understanding: what else follows? What is further implied or suggested? 
- Inspectional reading: focus on first 2 questions
- Analytical reading: must be able to answer last 2
- Syntopical reading: focus on last question
- Notes in book:
  - Underlining major points, imp/forceful statements
  - Vertical lines at the margin: instead of underlining long passages
  - Star/asterisk at the margin & fold corner: most imp statements/passages
  - Numbers in the margin: sequence of points in an argument
  - Number of other pages in the margin (eg p.11): same/related points, relevant or
  contradicting points
  - Writing in the margin/bottom of the page: questions & answers about a passage,
  summary, record of sequence of major points
  - Personal index of author's points in the back of the book
  - Outline as an integrated structure at the front pages
- 3 kinds of note-making:
  - Structural (inspectional reading)
  - Conceptual (analytical reading): the author's and your own concepts  
  -> Answers to questions about its truth & significance
  - Dialectical (syntopical reading): discussion engaged by all authors
- Forming reading habit:
  - Know the rule
  - Practice each individual acts until become proficient
  - Link individual acts together, focus on the overall goal

## II - The third level of reading: analytical reading

### 6. Categorizing a book
- **Analytical reading Rule 1**: you must know what kind of book you are reading,
asap, preferably before you read
- How: inspectional reading
- Fiction vs nonfiction:
  - Convey knowledge (broad sense) primarily
  - Consist of claimed-to-be-true opinions, theories, hypothesises, speculations
- Classify nonfiction: practical vs theoretical: what is the case vs what to do about it if we wish
  to get somewhere
- Types of practical book:
  - Manual
  - Moral treatise
  - Oration: political speech/moral exhortation
- Types of theoretical book:
  - History:
    - What happened in the past
    - Narrated
    - Chronotopic (particular time & place)
  - Science vs philosophy:
    - Laws & generalizations
    - Science:
      - Use experiments/observations outside normal/daily exp as
      supporting arguments
      - Need prior knowledge/training to understanding
    - Philosophy: armchair thinking, use normal/daily exp

### 7. X-raying a book
- **Rule 2**: state the unity of the whole book in a single/a few sentences:
  - Title
  - Intro
  - Read through
- **Rule 3**: set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized
into a whole, by being ordered to one another and toe the unity of the whole:
  - Divide into major parts
  - Divide major part into sections (not need to apply to full details)
  - Chapter divisions should only be used as a reference
- **Rule 4**: find out what the author's problems were  
-> Why the book has the unity it has, why the parts are organized that way
- Common questions:
  - Theoretical:
    - Existence of sth
    - Purpose of sth
    - Properties/characteristics
    - Relation to other things
  - Practical:
    - Aim
    - Mean
    - Right/wrong things to do
- => Rules 1-4 (structural rules) answer:  
What is the book about as a whole?

### 8. Coming to terms with an author
- Word: several meanings. Term (a word used unambiguously): 1 meaning
- Mapping: n to n
- Only for nonfiction works
- **Rule 5**: find the imp words and through them come to terms with the author
- Finding the keywords:
  - Word that give you trouble to understand a passage
  - Explicitly stressed by the author
  - Technical words:
    - Spot by acquaintance with the field
    - Not ordinary words -> technical
  - Small set of words that express an author's main ideas/leading concepts
- Finding the meanings:
  1. Determine whether the word has 1 or several meanings
  2. Determine the meaning: using meanings of all other words in the context
  that you do understand
- Make a  table: words/phrases | meanings

### 9. Determining an author's message
- Propositions (statements): declarations that sth is true -> argument
- Proposition & sentence: mapping n to n
- **Rule 6**: mark the most important sentences in a book and discover
the propositions they contain
- **Rule 7**: locate or construct the basic arguments in the book by finding them
in the connection of sentences
- Apply mainly to nonfiction work
- Finding the key sentences:
  - Dif for you to understand
  - Explicitly stress
  - Containing important words/terms
  - Belong to the main argument of the book
  - May form a sequence with beginning & end
- Finding the propositions (understand the key sens):
  - Based on surrounding sens
  - Separate dif propositions from the sen
  - Practice:
    - State in your own words
    - Give example: actual exp or imagination
- Finding the arguments:
  - Arguments might not correspond to paragraphs
  - May be constructed by sens from dif paragraphs
  - In summary passages at the end of section/chapter
  - Practice:
    - Put them into nutshell
    - Connect with other argument
  - Logical rules:
    - Argument involves several statements
    - 2 types of argument: induction vs deduction
    - Built upon by:
      - Assumptions
      - Self-evident propositions
      - Proved propositions
- **Rule 8**: find out what the author's solution to his problems are, what hasn't
been solved, among which what the author has acknowledged
- => Rule 5-8 (interpretive rules) answer:  
What is being said in details, and how? (interpreting the book's content)

### 10. Criticizing a book fairly
- **Rule 9**: you must be quite certain that you understand before you:
  - Agree
  - Disagree
  - Suspend judgement (need further evidence)
- To understand, sometimes need to:
  - Read the whole book
  - Read other works of the same author
- **Rule 10**: when you disagree, do so reasonably, not contentiously  
-> Learning the truth is what matters, not winning an argument
- Source of disagreement:
  - Misunderstanding
  - Lack of relevant knowledge
- **Rule 11**: respect the dif between knowledge and mere personal opinion
by giving reasons for any critical judgement you make
- Knowledge = opinions that can be defended by evidence
- View disagreement as generally remediable
- => Rule 9-11: general maxims of intellectual etiquette

### 11. Agreeing or disagreeing with an author
- How to disagree without prejudice and emotions:
  - Ack your emotions
  - Make your own assumptions explicit, compare with other's assumptions
  - Attempt to be impartial, avoid partisanship
- Points to disagree (be specific) with an authors:
  - **Rule 12**: He is uninformed: lack kno relevant to the problems
  he is trying to solve
  - **Rule 13**: He is misinformed: have error kno relevant to the problems  
  -> Rule 12 & 13: defects in premises, which leads to a dif conclusion/inability to
  solve a problem
  - **Rule 14**: He is illogical:
    - Failure to follow logical rule: conclusion not follow from reasons
    - Inconsistency in things that are said  
  - -> Can't disagree on first 3 points -> have to agree, at least in part
  - **Rule 15**: His analysis is incomplete: has not solved all the problems he
  started with  
  -> Can suspend judgement on the whole  
  -> Can compare with other works
- => Rules 9-15 (critical rules) answer:
  - Is it true?
  - What of it: need to ask this question if you determined what is said is true
- Read few books but well > read many but superficially

### 12. Aids to reading:
- 2 types of aids to reading:
  - Intrinsic: rely on the book itself: not realistic since there is always
  effect of past exp
  - Extrinsic: outside the book. Sometimes necessary for full understanding.  
  -> Don't depend too much on it. Try your best on intrinsic first, only use
  external help if still can't understand.
- 4 categories:
  - Relevant exp:
    - Common exp (not necessarily universal exp):
      - Fiction
      - Philosophy
      - History (narrative aspect)
    - Vs Special experience (lab, experiments...): scientific & history
    - Ensure proper use of exp: try give concrete examples
  - Other relevant books (esp as aids to read great books):
    - Read in chronological order
    - 1 way to understand an author: understand the books they read
    - Apply more to philosophy & history than science & fiction
    - Commentaries & handbooks, abstracts & plot digests:
      - 2 problems of commentaries:
        - Incorrect
        - Not exhaustive
      - Read commentaries only after reading the book, to answer what
      still puzzles you: avoid bias, approach the commentator on equal term
      - Abstract: useful for syntopical reading, to decide whether the book is relevant
      & should be read
      - Reference books (eg dictionary & cyclopedia):
        - 4 kinds of knowledge required to use ref books:
          - What you want to know
          - Where to find the answer: which kind of ref book
          - How the ref book is organize: read intro
          - What can be answered by ref book: facts, what is generally/conventionally
          agreed on
        - Dictionary:
          - Is about words
          - Should pay attention to order & relation of meanings of each word.
          - On first reading: only look up word if the word is imp for understanding
        - Cyclopedia:
          - Is about facts
          - Should pay attention about relation of facts (in 1 topic)  
          -> Could use the index, though not ideal
          - Remember that "fact", esp of science, can be falsified
          - The meaning of "fact" is culturally determined
          - Not a good tools for understanding: no arguments & imagination

## III - Approaches to dif kinds of reading matter
- Focus: dif kinds of questions to be asked & to be expected answers when reading
dif kinds of books

### 13. How to read practical books
- Practical books can't solve its problem all by itself: need judgement & action
of a particular situation  
-> Can only state general rules
- 2 types of practical books:
  - Focus on rules: arguments to prove the rules are sound:
    - Via principles
    - Via concrete examples
  - Focus on principles behind rules (eg economics, politics, morals): arguments
    (like those of theoretical books) to prove why sth is the case  
  -> Readers need to think about not mentioned rules & their application
- Practically true means:
  - The rule works
  - The end that it seeks is desirable for you  
  -> Author will try to persuade  
  -> Need to detect oratory parts
- Need to understand personality & background of the author to understand & judge
a practical book
- Adjustment of rules & questions:
  - Rule 4: find out what the author wants you to do
  - Rule 8: find out how the author proposes that you do this
  - Is it true: is his proposed goal also what you want to seek? Is the proposed means
  the best way of seeking it?
  - What of it: imply action on your part  
  -> No action = not agree. Exception: practical books applying to only certain people
    (eg food recipe)

### 14. How to read imaginative literature
- Readers of fiction usually:
  - Know what they enjoy
  - Don't know why they enjoy
- Fiction vs nonfiction:
  - Fiction:
    - Convey an experience only available in the book  
    -> Deeper reality of our inner life, not usually touched
    - Require imagination
    - Ambiguous words & metaphors
    - The parts depend on each other
  - Nonfiction:
    - Convey knowledge
    - Require intellect
    - Use unambiguous words
    - The parts are usually independently readable
- The Don'ts:
  - Resist its effect
  - Look for terms, propositions, arguments
  - Criticize by standard of truth & consistency  
  -> Criticize the authenticity & plausibility of the story in the world created by author
- Rules:
  - Structural:
    - Classification:
      - Lyric: single exp, no plot
      - Play: have a plot, only actions & speeches
      - Novel: novelist can speak in his own person (compared to play)
    - Unity: summarize the plot in 1-2 sens
    - Structure:
      - Events & incidents, beginning & ending
      - Climax & aftermath
  - Interpretive:
    - Elements (~terms):
      - Events
      - Characters
      - Characters' thoughts, speeches, feelings & actions
    - Static connections (~propositions): scene, background, world  
    -> Try to be in it
    - Dynamic connections: unravelling in the plot
  - Critical:
    - Try to experience it actively, only criticize after
    - Focus on what is good about the book and why, not what you like and dislike

### 15. Suggestions for reading stories, plays & poems
- 4th question: what of it? Not needed for fiction: it can lead to action, but don't
have to  
-> Implied statements can be in it, but not the essence of the work
- How to read stories:
  - Read quickly -> unity, relation of events
  - Read intensely & immersively -> details  
- -> Can grasp which characters/events are imp, which are not
- Why fictions are relevant: satisfy unconscious needs:
  - Our own needs:
    - Like & identify with certain kind of people: want them to end up well
    - Love more deeply
    - Sadism & masochism
  - Human needs: justice, understanding, reduced anxiety
  -> Bad stories: people get punished/rewarded randomly
- Epic poems: read Iliad, Odyssey, Aeneid, Divine comedy & Paradise lost
- Plays:
  - Need to imagine the background world
  - Try direct the play, imagine who it is acted
  - Read a dif passage out loud
- Tragedy:
  - Offer insight about life, as we still live it
  - Offer framework for other plays
  - How to read:
    - Pay attention to the lack of time & the need for immediate decision
    -> wrong decision
    - Protagonists are giant, superior
- Lyric poetry:
  - Read through without stopping
  - Read out loud the second time
  - Pay attention to imp words: in the rhyme, repeated
  - Pay attention to conflicts: between people, love & time, life & death,
  the transient & the eternal
  - Don't spend too much effort to study the context & author's background  
  -> Focus on the work
