### Additional info: Poker
- Less of a psychological game than a mathematical game:
depends on making probabilistic judgements under uncertainty
- Skills:
  - Basic skill:
    - Odd calculation
    - Decision-making:
      - Fold worst hands
      - Bet best hands
      - Make some effort to consider what the opponent holds
  - Analytic skill: hand reading: figure out
    - Which cards your opponent might hold
    - How they might affect her decisions throughout the rest of the hand
  - -> Think about many hypotheses, weight & balance against the opponent's actions
  - Make your play unpredictable
- Poker forecast: probabilistic:
  - Will become more precise as the hand is played out
  - But usually not possible to predict exactly which of the 1326 possible hands the opponent holds
- Common behavior:
  - Most players fold against a raise before the flop unless they have a decent hand
  - When a player call (not raise) before the flop:
      - Usually he has a decent hand
      - Unlikely that he has a strong hand (unless he tries to bait by slow playing)
  - When a player call after the flop:
    - 
- Thinking process:
  - First: others can't hold our cards
  - Break opponent's range into groups of hands functioning in the same ways
  - Hand groups & probabilities, call before flop:

- Behave unpredictably:
  - Aggressive play with hands like 7-6, same suit:
    - If big cards come onboard, opponent might give credit & fold
    - If small cards: might be able to make a pair
    - Sometimes can make straight/flush which can tilt opponent
  - -> When opponent catches on the style, they will call down when we have a better hands (eg pair of king)
