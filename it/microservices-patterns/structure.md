## Detailed structure
- Preface:
  - History of microservice architecture
  - The problems & how they will be addressed in the book
  - Reason to organize the book around patterns
- Chap 1:
  - Monolithic architecture: usage, advs & disadvs
  - Role of software architecture
  - Microservice architecture: usage, characteristics, advs & disadvs
  - Pattern & pattern language: def, characteristics, advs
  - Microservice pattern language: def, 3 layers, pattern groups
  - Process & organization: when working with microservice architecture
- Chap 2:
  - Concepts related to software architecture:
    - Dif views of architecture
    - Architectural styles: hexagonal, microservices
  - Steps to define microservice architecture for an app:
    - Identify system operations
    - Define services: difficulties & solution
    - Define API
- Chap 3:
  - Design issues related to IPC:
    - Types of interaction
    - Define & evolve API
