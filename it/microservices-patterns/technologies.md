# Technologies
- REST API definition:
  - Open API (openapis.org): most popular IDL:
  - Swagger project: set of tools for dev & documenting API, including tools to generate client stubs & server skeletons from an interface def
- RPC techs:
  - REST:
    - IPC mechanism that mostly uses HTTP
    - Characteristics:
      - Resource: represent a single or a collection of business objects
      - Use HTTP verbs for manipulating a resource (referenced using a URL)
    - REST maturity model:
      - Level 2: use HTTP verbs to perform actions: GET, POST, PUT
      - Level 3: representation of a resource returned by GET request contains link for performing actions on the resource
      - -> Don't have to hard-wire URLs into client code
    - Design issues:
      - Fetch multiple resources in a single request: use alternative API technologies (eg GraphQL, Netflix Falcor)
      - Map operations to HTTP verbs (eg dif types of update operations on the same resource)
  - gRPC:
    - Binary-message based protocol: use Protocol Buffer as message format
    - Use protobuf compiler to generate client-side stubs & server-side skeletons
    - Communication tech: HTTP/2
    - Bidirectional streaming features enable both RPC & messaging
- Service discovery:
  - Eureka: highly available service registry
  - Ribbon: HTTP client that supports Eureka client
- Brokerless messaging: ZeroMQ (zeromq.org)
- Transaction log tailing:
  - Debezium: publishes DB changes to Kafka
  - LinkedIn Databus: mine Oracle trans log & publishes change as events
  - DynamoDB streams
  - Eventuate Tram: use MySQL biglog/Postgres WAL/polling to read from outbox table & publish to Kafka
