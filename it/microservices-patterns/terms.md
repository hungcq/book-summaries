## List of microservice patterns
- Application architecture patterns:
  - Monolithic architecture (40)
  - Microservice architecture (40)
- Decomposition patterns:
  - Decompose by business capability (51)
  - Decompose by subdomain (54)
- Messaging style patterns:
  - Messaging (85)
  - Remote procedure invocation (72)
- Reliable communications patterns:
  - Circuit breaker: RPC proxy. Functions:
    - Track num of successful/failed requests
    - If error rate exceeds some threshold, trip the circuit breaker -> further attempts fail immediately
    - After a period, client can try again. Close the circuit if successful.
    - 3 states: closed, half-open, open
- Service discovery patterns:
  - 3rd party registration (85)
  - Client-side discovery (83)
  - Self-registration (82)
  - Server-side discovery (85)
- Transactional messaging patterns:
  - Transactional outbox: publish an event or message as part of a DB transaction by saving it in an outbox table in the DB
  - Polling publisher: publish messages by pulling the outbox table
  - Transaction log tailing: publish changes made to the DB by reading transaction logs of the outbox table
- Data consistency patterns:
  - Saga (114)
- Business logic design patterns:
  - Aggregate (150)
  - Domain event (160)
  - Domain model (150)
  - Event sourcing (184)
  - Transaction script (149)
- Querying patterns:
  - API composition (223)
  - Command query responsibility segregation (228)
- External API patterns:
  - API gateway (259)
  - Backends for frontends (265)
- Testing patterns:
  - Consumer-driven contract test (302)
  - Consumer-side contract test (303)
  - Service component test (335)
- Security patterns:
  - Access token (354)
- Cross-cutting concerns patterns:
  - Externalized configuration (361)
  - Microservice chassis (379)
- Observability patterns:
  - Application metrics (373)
  - Audit logging (377)
  - Distributed tracing (370)
  - Exception tracking (376)
  - Health check API (366)
  - Log aggregation (368)
- Deployment patterns:
  - Deploy a service as a container (393)
  - Deploy a service as a VM (390)
  - Language-specific packaging format (387)
  - Service mesh (380)
  - Serverless deployment (416)
  - Sidecar (410)
- Refactoring to microservices patterns:
  - Anti-corruption layer (447)
  - Strangler application (432)
## Terms
- Pattern: reusable solution to a problem that occur in a particular context
- Microservice pattern language: collection of interrelated software architecture and design patterns for microservices
- Software architecture: high level structure of a software, which consists of constituent parts & the dependencies between those parts
- Monolithic architecture: archi style that structures a system (implementation *view*) as a single executable or deployable component
- Microservice architecture: archi style that structures a system (implementation *view*) as a set of multiple loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- Service: standalone, independently deployable software component that implements some useful functionality
- Business capability: something that a business does in order to generate value (eg order management, item management, shipping...)
- IDL: interface definition language
- Service registry: database of network locations of an app's service instances
- Message broker: an intermediary through which all messages flow (sender -> broker -> receiver)
- Transactional messaging: publish messages as part of a transaction that updates the DB

- Strangler app: new app consisting of microservices, developed by implementing new functionality as services
  and extracting services from the monolith
