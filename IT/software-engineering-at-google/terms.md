# Testing
- Test size: resources needed to run the test
- Test scope: how much code is being validated (not executed) by a given test
- Hermetic: contain all the info necessary to set up, execute & tear down
- Code coverage: % feature code executed by tests
- Exploratory testing:
  - A form of manual testing
  - Interact with a product via a public API, try new paths/user scenarios in the system
  - Looking for:
    - Behavior deviating from expected/intuitive behavior
    - Security vulnerability
